    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p class="paragraf1">
        Strawberries are sweet supple red fruits with surfaces that are seed-studded. They come from a 
        low-growing plant belonging to genus <i>Fragaria</i> of the rose (<i>Rosaceae</i>) family, enclosing white 
        flowers, lobed foliage, and runners. They originate all through the north temperate zones.
    </p>

    <p>
        They are the most famous and trendiest fruits on the planet (Roger). There are over 600 assortments 
        of strawberries that vary in taste, size, and feel; all of which have similar traits: heart-shaped 
        silhouette, red fleshy tissue with yellow seeds on the surface, petite, royal, leafy green lids, and 
        stalk that embellish their crowns (WHFoods).
    </p>

    <h2>Detailed History</h2>
    <p class="paragraf2">
        The word "strawberry" is coined from "strewn" berries about the plants and thus the "strewn berry" (Roger).
        They are not actual fruits or berries but distended ends of the stamen of the plant. The seeds are on the 
        external surface, rather than inside. Each berry has around 200 seeds. They are low in calories and are 
        non-fat, loaded with vitamin C, folic acid, fiber, vitamin B5, and potassium (Roger).
    </p>

    <p>
        Over the years, they have been used as medications for ailments like stained teeth, sunburns, gouts, and 
        digestion issues (Hopley, 9). Strawberries were served at medieval state occasions as a sign of peace, 
        wealth, and excellence. The most well-known communal intake of strawberries is at Wimbledon annually, 
        where strawberries and cream are eaten by well-dressed Englishmen in the middle of tennis games (Hopley, 9).
    </p>

    <h2>Various Uses of Strawberries</h2>
    <p class="paragraf3">
        Strawberries have numerous uses. One of the most famous uses of strawberries is in recipes or as an 
        ingredient in the preparation of drinks, meals, or snacks. They are used in many types of food, such as 
        cakes, yogurts, desserts, salads, juices, meals, and chocolates.
